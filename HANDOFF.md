# HANDOFF.md

Session handoff document for the vortex-jepa project.

Last updated: 2026-05-15.

If you are picking up this project mid-stream (new collaborator, new Claude session, or
returning after a break), read this document first. CLAUDE.md is the operational guide.
This file is the decision history and the rationale.

## Project summary

We are building an end-to-end Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) for
parametric vortex-gust airfoil interactions at Re = 5000. The scientific aim is a paper
that:

1. Demonstrates JEPA-style self-supervised representation learning is viable on fluid
   mechanics data with low intrinsic dimensionality.
2. Beats or matches Fukami et al. (PRF 2025) and Solera-Rico et al. (Nat. Commun. 2024)
   on forecasting horizon and probing R^2 at matched latent dimension d.
3. Honestly reports the SIGReg-on-low-intrinsic-dim diagnostic, contributing the
   participation-ratio criterion as a reusable JEPA-for-science methodology.

Researcher: Carlos Sanmiguel Vila (INTA, UC3M).

## Data location (important)

The raw DNS data does NOT live in this repository. It is owned by the PREVENT project
(Carlos's ML turbulence detection effort, which produced these DNS runs), and is shared
with vortex-jepa by reference, not by copy.

- Set `PREVENT_ROOT` to the PREVENT project root before running anything. On Carlos's
  workstation this is `$HOME/PREVENT`. Data files are at
  `${PREVENT_ROOT}/data/raw/periodic/` and `${PREVENT_ROOT}/data/raw/periodic/run3/`.
- The vortex-jepa repo contains only `data_manifest/raw_cases_inventory.yaml` (a
  snapshot of the PREVENT-side inventory at bootstrap time) and `configs/splits/split_v1.json` at the
  repo root (the locked split manifest). Both reference the data by relative path;
  resolution is `Path(PREVENT_ROOT) / case["relative_path"]`.
- If PREVENT regenerates its inventory, copy the new YAML over and re-run
  `python build_split_manifest.py`. The split manifest pins
  `source_inventory.sha256` so a stale inventory will be visible at load time.
- The preprocessed per-encounter cache lives at `${VORTEX_JEPA_CACHE}/{partition}/`
  (default `${PREVENT_ROOT}/data/processed/vortex-jepa/`). Partition v1 currently
  holds 214 encounters (~1.35 GB) across 43 cases (extended once by D12). See
  `configs/preprocessing.yaml` for the cache parameters.

## Decision history

Decisions are listed in the order they were taken, each with rationale and alternatives
considered.

### D1: End-to-end JEPA (not hybrid two-stage VAE + transformer)

We pursue an end-to-end LeWM-style JEPA rather than the hybrid scheme that would replicate
Solera-Rico more closely.

Rationale: methodologically more novel, harder to reproduce well, aligns the latent
geometry with the predictive task. The hybrid is retained as one of four required
matched-capacity baselines for the paper.

Alternative considered and deferred: a Fukami-style observable-augmented AE + LSTM/
transformer two-stage system. Listed as the `fukami_ae` baseline.

### D2: Trajectory framing (full-episode autoregressive transformer predictor)

Episodes are treated as full latent trajectories z_{1:T} with c = (G, D, Y) as static
episode descriptor. The predictor is an autoregressive transformer over time with c
injected via AdaLN-Zero plus a time-varying phase variable phi_t.

Rationale: closer to the Solera-Rico transformer-in-latent-space precedent, has known
long-horizon stability under scheduled sampling, matches the V-JEPA 2-AC training
recipe (Assran et al. 2025). Pure one-step LeWM-style prediction with N = 3 history
is too short for vortex impact dynamics (impact lasts ~5 to 10 t/c, which is ~30 frames
at dt = 0.05).

Alternative considered: LeWM exactly (N = 3 history, frame-skip 5). Rejected because the
gust impact dynamics needs longer temporal context.

### D3: Encoder is hybrid CNN + ViT

CNN stem (3 downsampling stages, channels 64 to 256) followed by 6-layer transformer
(hidden 256, 8 heads), pooled to d = 32 via a [CLS] token plus a 1-layer MLP with
BatchNorm.

Rationale: vortex cores have strong local structure (CNN good), but airfoil-vortex
relative configuration is global (attention good). The RTX 6000 96 GB does not impose
parameter budget constraints, so we use the model that best matches the inductive bias.

Alternatives considered:
- Pure ViT-Tiny patch 14 (LeWM exact): rejected as patch-coarse for vortex cores at this
  resolution. Listed as an ablation.
- Pure ConvNet: rejected because it does not match LeWM's SIGReg-on-projection recipe
  cleanly. Listed as an ablation.
- 4-stage CNN stem (input (192, 96) -> 12 x 6 feature map at 256 channels = 72 spatial
  tokens). Not committed in v1; recorded as the deferred "shallow-stem" ablation
  (cheaper attention, coarser features). Decision tabled until the main 3-stage run
  produces results to compare against. A 2-stage variant (48 x 24 = 1152 tokens) is
  also possible but not currently tabled.

### D4: Latent dimension d = 32

Default for the main runs. Sensitivity sweep over {8, 16, 32, 64, 128} is a required
ablation.

Rationale: Fukami's PRF 2025 vortex-gust at Re = 5000 shows three latent dimensions
suffice for reconstruction. Choosing d = 32 leaves SIGReg room to spread the distribution
without enforcing isotropy in a near-singular embedding. The intrinsic dimension of the
manifold is believed to be roughly 5 to 10 (3 static parameters plus impact phase plus
shedding phase plus residual), so d = 32 is roughly 3x to 6x the intrinsic dimension.

### D5: SIGReg with auto-fallback to VICReg

Default anti-collapse: SIGReg with M = 256 projections, 17 Epps-Pulley knots in [0.2, 4],
lambda = 0.1, tuned by bisection over [0.001, 1.0].

Auto-fallback rule (hard-coded): if at iteration 20k the participation ratio
PR < 0.3 * d AND linear probe R^2 for c < 0.7, switch to VICReg with mu = 25.0,
nu = 1.0 (Bardes, Ponce, LeCun, ICLR 2022).

Rationale: LeWM is the published precedent. SIGReg's isotropic Gaussian prior may be
mismatched with the low intrinsic dimension of this dataset, as demonstrated by the LeWM
Two-Room failure mode. The fallback to VICReg matches first and second moments without
forcing higher-order Gaussianity, which is safer for low-intrinsic-dim data.

### D6: Conditioning on c only in the predictor, not the encoder

c = (G, D, Y) enters AdaLN-Zero in every predictor block, plus a time-varying phase
variable phi_t. The encoder is unconditional.

Rationale: a static descriptor injected into the encoder short-circuits the JEPA: the
encoder could learn z_t = c and the predictor would be trivial. The V-JEPA 2-AC, LeWM,
Brain-JEPA, and Echo-JEPA precedents all use predictor-only conditioning.

Sanity ablation: a variant with c in the encoder. We expect probing R^2 for c to remain
high (because the encoder sees c directly) but forecasting horizon to degrade, since the
latent now encodes c redundantly and loses capacity for state.

### D7: Data split locked in configs/splits/split_v1.json (superseded in part by D9)

Single split, no k-fold for the moment. K-fold is deferred until a candidate architecture
is promising (avoid burning compute on cross-validation of architectures that do not work).

Final split (as updated by D9, then amended by D12, all on 2026-05-15):
- Train: 33 cases, 114 encounters (first 4 of 6 periodic, first 3 of 4 run3).
  Baseline is included as a periodic train case.
- Test A (impact-instant generalization): same 33 cases, 48 held-out last encounters
  (last 2 of 6 periodic, last 1 of 4 run3). Baseline contributes its last 2 encounters.
- Test B (parametric interpolation): 6 interior cases pooled across source groups,
  28 encounters.
- Test C (extrapolation, G = +4): 4 cases, 24 encounters, never used for selection.
- 1 calibration reference (Baseline), flagged `is_calibration_reference: true` so
  calibration tools can identify the no-gust reference; it is in train + Test A as
  above, not a separate split.

|G| = 3 stays in training (extrapolation axis is asymmetric: only G = +4 is held out).
Periodic trailing partials are discarded.
Impact frame estimate is 40 (vortex centroid crosses LE at t ~ 1.965 t/c).
Sub-trajectory L = 32 with 70 percent impact-aware sampling, 30 percent uniform.

### D8: PLDM added as the fourth matched-capacity baseline

Final baseline list: POD, Fukami observable-augmented AE, Solera-Rico beta-VAE +
transformer, and PLDM (Position-based Latent Dynamics Model, Sobal, Jyothir, Jalagam,
Carion, Cho, LeCun, arXiv:2211.10831, 2022; stress-tested in Sobal et al. 2025).

Rationale: PLDM is the direct end-to-end JEPA-from-pixels precursor to LeWM, with a
7-term VICReg-derived objective and six tunable weights. LeWM cites PLDM as the previous
end-to-end alternative and reports an 18 percent gain on Push-T with the simpler 2-term
objective. For our paper, PLDM is the "previous end-to-end JEPA" baseline, and the
contrast SIGReg + 2-term (proposed) vs VICReg + 7-term (PLDM) is the central
methodological claim: simpler anti-collapse plus O(log n) bisection beats PLDM's
O(n^6) grid search, on physics data.

The PLDM seven loss terms (per Sobal et al. 2022 and 2025):
1. Prediction (next-embedding MSE)
2. Variance regularization on z per dimension (VICReg-style hinge)
3. Covariance regularization on z (off-diagonal Frobenius)
4. Temporal smoothness (||z_{t+1} - z_t||^2)
5. Variance regularization on the temporal-difference signal
6. Covariance regularization on the temporal-difference signal
7. Inverse-dynamics-model loss (predict a_t from z_t, z_{t+1})

For our setup with no per-step action, term 7 is replaced by an inverse-dynamics MLP
predicting (G, D, Y, phi_t) from (z_t, z_{t+1}). Implement PLDM faithfully so the
comparison is fair.

### D9: Baseline moved into train + Test A (2026-05-15)

Baseline (the no-gust periodic case, G = D = Y = 0) is now a member of `train`
(encounters 0-3) and Test A (encounters 4-5) like any other periodic case. The
per-case metadata still carries `is_calibration_reference: true` so calibration code
can find the no-gust reference.

Rationale: Carlos directed this on 2026-05-15 during the bootstrap session ("It should
be also be used"). Reserving Baseline for calibration only deprives the JEPA predictor
of clean shedding dynamics at G = 0, which is needed to model the no-gust limit.
The previous policy (D7 as originally written) is superseded by this entry.

Effect on counts:
- Train cases: 30 -> 31
- Train encounters: 104 -> 108
- Test A encounters: 44 -> 46
- A new `n_cases_calibration_reference` field in `configs/splits/split_v1.json` summary equals 1.

Alternative considered: keep Baseline excluded from train but make it accessible by
flag for calibration runs. Rejected because it duplicates the data path and adds a
special case the model never sees during training.

### D10: Path layout for the bootstrap session (2026-05-15, revised same day)

The aspirational repo layout in CLAUDE.md places the split manifest under
`configs/splits/`, the inventory under `configs/`, and the build script under
`scripts/`. At the start of the bootstrap session all three files were elsewhere
(`split_v1.json` at the repo root, `data_manifest/raw_cases_inventory.yaml`,
`build_split_manifest.py` at the repo root). The original D10 left them in place
to avoid rewiring relative paths mid-session.

Carlos approved moving the split manifest later the same day. Final state after
the Session 1 follow-up:

- `configs/splits/split_v1.json` - moved here from the repo root via `git mv`,
  contents unchanged. SHA256 of the manifest is unchanged by the move:
  `44ea16ba87dfbfd6ec78a165553c1d95b0df329afa6d711774a592f12bb7aa21`. All code
  and doc references updated to the new path; the four-check loader smoke test
  still passes.
- `data_manifest/raw_cases_inventory.yaml` - stays at `data_manifest/`. The
  divergence from the aspirational `configs/raw_cases_inventory.yaml` is
  low-stakes and may be revisited.
- `build_split_manifest.py` - stays at the repo root. Carlos's spec mentions
  it by name without a directory; relocation under `scripts/` is also a
  low-stakes divergence and may be revisited.

### D11: Rename impact_aware_start_range -> impact_overlap_start_range (2026-05-15)

The locked range `[8, 40]` with `L = 32` produces sub-trajectories whose intersection
with the impact window `[25, 55]` contains at least 7 frames. This is what the
"impact-aware" branch of the sampler actually guarantees. The previous name
suggested "guarantees frame 40 is in the sub-trajectory", which is true only for
`start >= 9` (since `start = 8` yields `[8, 40)`).

Resolution: rename the field to `impact_overlap_start_range` everywhere
(`configs/splits/split_v1.json`, `build_split_manifest.py`, `src/data/episode_dataset.py`).
`impact_aware_fraction` keeps its name (it is the mixture weight, not a range).
Behavior is unchanged; the 0.814 observed vs 0.811 predicted impact-overlap
fraction is the validation that the sampler does what it should.

Rationale: the issue was purely a misleading name; the math and code are correct.
Renaming is the lowest-risk fix and avoids the alternatives (shift range to
`[9, 40]` or widen to `L = 33`, both of which change behavior). The semantics are
now documented inline in the `subtrajectory_sampling.rationale` field of
`configs/splits/split_v1.json` and in the `EpisodeDataset` docstring.

Alternative considered: redefine `L` or the range so frame 40 is strictly
in-window. Rejected because behavior is fine; the original name was wrong.

`configs/splits/split_v1.json` SHA256 after the rename:
`44ea16ba87dfbfd6ec78a165553c1d95b0df329afa6d711774a592f12bb7aa21`. This is the
manifest hash to log under `split_sha256` in W&B (see CLAUDE.md "Logging (W&B)").

### D12: Absorb two new run3 cases into v1 (2026-05-15, late session)

Carlos's collaborator dropped two run3 files in `$PREVENT_ROOT/data/raw/periodic/run3/`
(`Gust_023_x-1.989_y-0.290_s1.0_d1.5.h5` and
`Gust_024_x-1.892_y-0.678_s-1.0_d1.0.h5`). Decoded:
- `G+1.00_D1.50_Y+0.20` (run3, defaults to `train`)
- `G-1.00_D1.00_Y-0.20` (run3, defaults to `train`)

Rather than create v2 (which the original plan in SESSION_DATA_PREP.md Step 5 would
prescribe), the two cases were absorbed directly into v1 per Carlos's direction
("Add everything into v1, update whatever you need"). v1 is no longer the 41-case
partition it was at the close of the bootstrap session; it is now 43 cases /
214 encounters.

Rationale: at this stage of the project (Session 2 starting on three model
primitives), maintaining a separate v2 partition for two extra cases would add
versioning overhead with little benefit. v1 has not yet produced any reported
training checkpoint, so the partition-immutability rule in D5 has not yet had to
bite. Once v1 produces a paper-reportable checkpoint, the next absorption MUST
go to v2.

Effect on counts:
- Train cases: 31 -> 33 (+2 new run3 train cases).
- Train encounters: 108 -> 114 (+6 = 2 cases x 3 encounters each).
- Test A encounters: 46 -> 48 (+2 = 2 cases x 1 encounter each).
- Total cases: 41 -> 43.
- Total encounters: 206 -> 214.

Cache:
- 8 new encounter files written to
  `${VORTEX_JEPA_CACHE}/v1/{G+1.00_D1.50_Y+0.20, G-1.00_D1.00_Y-0.20}/encounter_*.h5`.
- The 206 existing encounter files are untouched (preprocess.py skipped them).

`configs/splits/split_v1.json` regenerated. New SHA256:
`0f07a746383dc38e0ea7c4841d3559468ca8b4d9e2e2ab493996ac636c07a096`
(the pre-absorption SHA documented in D11 is `44ea16ba...`, preserved in git
history at commit 78b0fa1). When logging W&B `split_sha256` for runs that touch
the absorbed v1, use the new hash.

Alternative considered: build v2 with these two cases (per the original Step 5
plan). Rejected as premature partition-versioning at the current pre-training
stage. The four-check loader smoke test was re-run with the updated counts and
still passes (114 / 48 / 28 / 24, overlap fraction 0.804, seed=42 reproducible).

### D15: Absorb one more run3 case into v1 (2026-05-16, late)

Carlos's collaborator dropped a third run3 file in
`$PREVENT_ROOT/data/raw/periodic/run3/` later the same day as D14
(`Gust_028_x-1.989_y-0.290_s-0.5_d0.5.h5`, timestamped 2026-05-16 21:17;
Gust_027 was skipped by the collaborator's numbering, the same pattern
as the earlier missing Gust_018). Decoded with the locked alpha=14 degree
rotation:

- `G-0.50_D0.50_Y+0.20`  (run3, defaults to `train`)

The new case_id does not collide with the existing inventory; |G|=0.5 stays
inside the training envelope (|G| <= 3, only |G|=4 is held out in Test C).

Same precedent as D12 and D14: v1 still has no paper-reportable training
checkpoint, so this absorption stays in v1. The next absorption after the
first reportable v1 run MUST go to v2.

Effect on counts (cumulative since D14):
- Train cases: 35 -> 36 (+1 run3 train case).
- Train encounters: 120 -> 123 (+3 = 1 case x 3 train-encounter slots).
- Test A encounters: 50 -> 51 (+1 = 1 case x 1 held-out encounter).
- Total cases: 45 -> 46.
- Total encounters: 222 -> 226.

Cache:
- 4 new encounter files written at
  `${VORTEX_JEPA_CACHE}/v1/G-0.50_D0.50_Y+0.20/encounter_*.h5`.
- The 222 pre-existing encounter files are untouched (preprocess.py skipped them).

`data_manifest/raw_cases_inventory.yaml` regenerated via
`scripts/100c_raw_cases_inventory.py`; summary now reports
`n_cases_total: 46`, `n_cases_periodic: 21`, `n_cases_run3: 25`,
`n_parse_errors: 0`, `n_duplicate_case_ids: 0`. New inventory SHA256:
`2b7d7a240c92b191684c29d7b6c721c8dff23543216620b4c02cdfcb00641611`
(pinned in the split manifest at `source_inventory.sha256`).

`configs/splits/split_v1.json` regenerated via `python build_split_manifest.py`.
New SHA256:
`9df7b733b9bc0161aed205571f3a0273416e829fda9d7a6660f9bb7aa040a81a`
(D14's hash `f21abb5d48008031d628042bd46743a82e3dd28c194e8a66dc22e7dee8b8bf8c`
is preserved in git history at commit 77b71fc). When logging W&B
`split_sha256` for runs that touch the absorbed v1, use the new hash.

Alternative considered: build v2 with this case alongside D14's two cases.
Rejected for the same reason as D12/D14 -- premature partition-versioning
while the project still has no v1 training checkpoint.

### D14: Absorb two more run3 cases into v1 (2026-05-16)

Carlos's collaborator dropped two more run3 files in
`$PREVENT_ROOT/data/raw/periodic/run3/` overnight
(`Gust_025_x-1.916_y-0.581_s-1.0_d1.5.h5` and
`Gust_026_x-1.989_y-0.290_s-1.5_d1.0.h5`, both timestamped 2026-05-16 09:17).
Decoded with the locked alpha=14 degree rotation:

- `G-1.00_D1.50_Y-0.10`  (run3, defaults to `train`)
- `G-1.50_D1.00_Y+0.20`  (run3, defaults to `train`)

Both new case_ids do not collide with the existing inventory; both stay
inside |G| <= 3, so neither pushes the extrapolation envelope (|G| = 4 stays
held out in Test C).

Following D12's pattern, these were absorbed into v1 rather than v2: v1 has
still not produced a paper-reportable training checkpoint, so the
partition-immutability rule has not yet had to bite. The next absorption
after the first reportable v1 run MUST go to v2.

Effect on counts:
- Train cases: 33 -> 35 (+2 new run3 train cases).
- Train encounters: 114 -> 120 (+6 = 2 cases x 3 train-encounter slots each).
- Test A encounters: 48 -> 50 (+2 = 2 cases x 1 held-out encounter each).
- Total cases: 43 -> 45.
- Total encounters: 214 -> 222.

Cache:
- 8 new encounter files written at
  `${VORTEX_JEPA_CACHE}/v1/{G-1.00_D1.50_Y-0.10, G-1.50_D1.00_Y+0.20}/encounter_*.h5`.
- The 214 pre-existing encounter files are untouched (preprocess.py skipped them).

`data_manifest/raw_cases_inventory.yaml` regenerated via
`scripts/100c_raw_cases_inventory.py`; summary now reports
`n_cases_total: 45`, `n_cases_periodic: 21`, `n_cases_run3: 24`,
`n_parse_errors: 0`, `n_duplicate_case_ids: 0`. New inventory SHA256:
`d67d65d369097875403169c8065f56d4612479be2b4712a177d8d7505d76f74f`

`configs/splits/split_v1.json` regenerated via `python build_split_manifest.py`.
New SHA256:
`f21abb5d48008031d628042bd46743a82e3dd28c194e8a66dc22e7dee8b8bf8c`
(D12's hash `0f07a746383dc38e0ea7c4841d3559468ca8b4d9e2e2ab493996ac636c07a096`
is preserved in git history at commit 029226f). When logging W&B
`split_sha256` for runs that touch the absorbed v1, use the new hash.

Alternative considered: build v2 with these two cases. Rejected for the same
reason as D12 -- premature partition-versioning while the project still has
no v1 training checkpoint to compare against.

### D13: SIGReg follows LeWM Appendix A, no N multiplier (2026-05-16)

The Session 2 implementation of `src/models/sigreg.py` uses the LeWM appendix-A
definition of the Epps-Pulley statistic:

```
T^(m) = integral over t of  w(t) * |phi_N(t; h^(m)) - phi_0(t)|^2  dt
SIGReg(Z) = (1 / M) sum_m T^(m)
```

There is no leading `N` multiplier. This contradicts the official LeJEPA paper
PyTorch listing (arXiv:2511.08544, Lst. "epps-pulley-pytorch"), which ends with
`T = torch.trapz(err, t, dim=1) * N`. The applied LeWM paper (arXiv:2603.19312
appendix A, equation EP) gives the definition without the `N` multiplier and is
the more authoritative source for this project's training recipe.

Effect on the unit-test thresholds in `tests/test_sigreg.py`: the original
SESSION2_MODEL_PRIMITIVES.md spec proposed thresholds (Gaussian < 0.1,
Student-t df=2 > 5.0, Uniform > 1.0) that are not simultaneously satisfiable
under either convention (with multiplier the Gaussian asymptotic mean is ~1.0;
without it the Student-t empirical value at B=4096 is ~0.12). Thresholds were
re-calibrated empirically against a numpy reference for the no-multiplier
formula on B=4096 batches:

- Gaussian            < 0.01   (empirical ~ 1e-4)
- Student-t df=2      > 0.05   (empirical ~ 0.12)
- Uniform(-1, 1)      > 0.02   (empirical ~ 0.05)

All six SIGReg unit tests pass. The relative ordering (Gaussian << Uniform <
Student-t) is preserved and is what the regularizer needs to discriminate to
work as an anti-collapse signal. The numerical scale of SIGReg in training is
absorbed into the outer regularization weight `lambda` (CLAUDE.md "Locked
decisions" allows `lambda` to be tuned by bisection over [0.001, 1.0]); the
choice of scaling here does not affect the bisection's logical search range,
only the numerical value of the optimum.

Alternative considered: use the LeJEPA paper code's `* N` multiplier and
re-calibrate the Gaussian threshold up to < 2.0. Rejected because LeWM is the
direct architectural template for this project (CLAUDE.md), and the LeJEPA
paper's main-text definition (Section 4.2.3, equation Epps-Pulley) is also
written without the multiplier; the `* N` in the PyTorch listing is an
implementation choice that does not survive the appendix-A presentation that
LeWM cites.

Knot range stays at `[0.2, 4]` per the spec, even though LeJEPA's reference
code uses `[-5, 5]`. The half-axis choice is harmless: the integrand is
symmetric in `t` and the integrand at `t in [0, 0.2)` is negligible (both
phi_N and phi_0 equal 1 at `t = 0`).

## Open questions

1. Empirical impact frame. The estimate of 40 was validated in the bootstrap session
   on the cached partition v1: vorticity-domain argmax mean = 40.8, force-domain
   argmax mean = 38.8 (both over the [25, 55] window). The distribution is bimodal in
   the vorticity domain (strong gusts peak pre-impact, weak gusts post-impact) and
   tighter in the force domain. The configs/splits/split_v1.json estimate of 40 is retained.
   Resolved.

2. Frame-skip. Default is 2, giving 60 effective frames per encounter at dt_eff = 0.1.
   Verify against impact dynamics resolution. Frame-skip 1 (no skipping) is also viable
   on the 96 GB GPU.

3. Lambda bisection budget. Six evaluations over [0.001, 1.0]. If the optimum is near
   LeWM's default 0.1, stop the bisection early and log this as a robustness result.

4. Auxiliary observable head. Should the JEPA optionally produce wall pressure or C_L
   as a side prediction? Default is no (per LeWM). Reserve as an ablation only; if it
   substantially helps probe R^2, it is reportable as a hybrid contribution.

5. C-JEPA-style gust masking ablation. Requires defining the "gust object" region per
   episode. The vortex centroid is computable analytically from launch position plus
   U_inf * t. A circular mask of radius D around the centroid would zero out the gust
   in selected frames. Optional ablation; only run if the main results are promising.

6. Symmetry augmentation. The flow has approximate Y -> -Y reflection symmetry combined
   with G -> -G and omega_z -> -omega_z. Adding this as a paired augmentation roughly
   doubles the effective training data. Implement but ablate to verify it does not
   destabilize SIGReg.

(D11 closes the prior off-by-one item for impact_aware_start_range.)

## Suggested next steps (ordered)

1. (Done, 2026-05-15) Data loader at `src/data/episode_dataset.py`. Verified across
   all four splits; impact-aware fraction 0.814 vs predicted 0.811; reproducible with
   seed. See SESSION_REPORT_2026-05-15.md.

2. Build the encoder (`src/models/encoder.py`) and predictor (`src/models/predictor.py`)
   with unit tests for shape contracts, AdaLN-Zero identity initialization, and causal
   masking.

3. Build SIGReg (`src/models/sigreg.py`) and the participation-ratio diagnostic
   (`src/training/diagnostics.py`). Unit-test SIGReg against scipy.stats.normaltest on
   Gaussian samples.

4. Smoke-test training run: 5k iterations on a tiny subset (5 training cases) to verify
   the loss converges, the latent does not collapse, and the visualization decoder
   produces recognizable fields. Pass criteria: SIGReg loss below 5.0 at iter 5000,
   participation ratio above 0.5 * d, probe R^2 for c above 0.5 on Test B.

5. Lambda bisection at full data: six evaluations of 24k iterations each. Pick the
   lambda maximizing Test A probe R^2.

6. Full training of the chosen lambda for 80k iterations. Train the visualization
   decoder on the frozen encoder. Run the full Section-7 evaluation suite.

7. Baselines in parallel: PLDM, Fukami AE, Solera-Rico beta-VAE, POD on the same split
   with the same evaluation metrics.

8. Ablation matrix (the 15 ablations from the architecture spec). Mandatory: ablations
   1 (d sweep), 2 (SIGReg vs VICReg vs none), 7 (teacher forcing vs scheduled sampling
   vs full rollout), 10 (Solera-Rico baseline), 11 (Fukami AE baseline), plus the new
   PLDM baseline.

9. Paper writing.

## Warnings and pitfalls

- SIGReg requires BatchNorm projection at the encoder bottleneck. Do NOT use LayerNorm
  at the latent boundary. The final ViT LayerNorm followed by a BatchNorm-projected MLP
  is the correct LeWM pattern.
- AdaLN-Zero initialization is mandatory: the final linear layer producing
  (shift, scale, gate) must be zero-initialized so the predictor starts as
  identity-on-residual. Verify in `tests/test_adaln_zero.py`.
- bf16 mixed precision is fine for encoder + predictor, but compute Epps-Pulley in fp32
  for numerical stability. The characteristic function involves complex exponentials
  whose magnitude is well-bounded but whose differences are not.
- The training set is small (114 train encounters). Use spanwise mirror, small temporal
  jitter on episode start, and the optional (Y, G, omega_z) sign-flip symmetry. Do NOT
  use rotations.
- High probe R^2 on the encoder for c is a red flag, not a success. The encoder is
  unconditional by design; if it can decode c, c is leaking from somewhere (the wrong
  data path, an auxiliary channel, or the BatchNorm statistics correlating with c).
- The "AeroJEPA" preprint may appear in the literature search during the project. It is
  a likely direct competitor. When it becomes available, summarize differences in
  `notebooks/literature_aerojepa.ipynb` and update the paper introduction accordingly.
- Omega_z DNS sign convention is `du/dy - dv/dx` (opposite of the standard right-hand
  rule). Magnitudes are correct; only the sign flips. If you plot omega_z and "positive
  rotation" looks inverted, it is the convention, not a bug. See SESSION_DATA_PREP.md
  Step 0 status section.
